Love of wisdom

4th of March 2017 was the creation date of my very first [Github repository](https://github.com/kevinabouhanna/hello-world).\
4th of November 2020 is today where I decided to update my personal website;
That's exactly 3 years and 6 months since the beginning of my journey into the world of programming.

What a beautiful coincidence.

Amor fati indeed...
